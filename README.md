## Overview

This project aims to detect melanoma cancer and classify it as malignant or benign using machine learning techniques. Melanoma is a type of skin cancer that can be fatal if not detected and treated early. This model helps in early detection and decision-making for medical professionals.

## Features

- **Image Classification:** The model analyzes images of skin lesions and predicts whether they are malignant or benign.
- **Scalability:** The model can be scaled to handle a large number of images for efficient processing.
- **Accuracy:** The model has been trained on a comprehensive dataset to achieve high accuracy in classification.

## Usage

1. **Installation:**

   Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/shukurullo2004/melanoma_detection.git
2. **Dependencies:**

Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. You can install them using:
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. **Running the Model:**

Execute the model by running:

python detect_melanoma.py image_path


Replace `image_path` with the path to the image you want to analyze.

## Model Deployment

You can also access the deployed model on Hugging Face's model hub:

[Melanoma Detection Model - Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/spaces/shukurullo2004/melanoma_detect)

## Dataset

The model has been trained on a dataset consisting of various skin lesion images labeled as malignant or benign. The dataset was carefully curated to ensure diversity and accuracy in classification.

## Results

The model has achieved an accuracy of X% on the test dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in melanoma detection.
